### Methodology Overview

The Time-Windowed Attraction Priority (T-WAP) algorithm is designed to optimize travel planning by using historical visitor data and real-time updates to avoid peak crowd times and optimize travel routes. Here's a detailed breakdown of the methodology:

### 1. **Data Collection**
- **Historical Data:** Collect historical visitor data from various attractions in Karnataka. This data includes the number of visitors, peak visiting hours, and seasonal trends.
- **Real-Time Data:** Gather real-time data on current visitor numbers, weather conditions, traffic updates, and any ongoing events or festivals that might affect travel plans.

### 2. **Data Analysis**
- **Pattern Identification:** Analyze the historical data to identify patterns and trends in visitor numbers. Determine the typical peak and off-peak times for each attraction.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Use machine learning techniques to predict future visitor numbers based on historical trends and current conditions.

### 3. **Algorithm Design**
- **Priority Assignment:** Assign a priority score to each attraction based on factors such as current crowd levels, historical popularity, and user preferences.
- **Time Windows:** Divide the day into multiple time windows. For each time window, calculate the expected visitor numbers and update the priority scores accordingly.
- **Route Optimization:** Develop an algorithm to optimize travel routes by considering the priority scores, distance between attractions, and travel time. This ensures that travelers visit attractions when they are least crowded.

### 4. **Implementation**
- **Integration with Maps:** Integrate the T-WAP algorithm with mapping and navigation services to provide real-time route suggestions.
- **User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface that allows travelers to input their preferences and receive customized travel plans. The interface should provide real-time updates and suggestions.
